1. Board Preferences:- http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
then go to tools>board>board manager
search for esp8266 and then install

2. Select tools>boards>NodeMCU 0.9
Select port.
if port is not visible then check for drivers
USB Driver and USB to UART Driver

3. Built-in LED Glow
File>Example>ESP8266>Blink
Compile and upload
Change the values and run again.

4. External LED
Connect the simple circuit and run the code.

5. External LED 2 at once
Connect them in series and run the code.

6. Controlling through web server
Provide them a code and explain them the code.
Then upload and observe the serial monitor.
Check the baud rate if error occurs.
If still error continues then download 8266 NodeMCU Library
NodeMCU Libraries:-
https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino

7. Control through Blynk app.
Download the blynk app from playstore
register with your email account(prefer gmail over facebook)
then click on Create
Give name to project
select board as nodemcu
choose wifi type
click create to finish
then blynk will send a auth code to your emailid registered now.
Copy that code for futher use

Add button to your project
click on button and rename it with whatever you want
select digital pin d3
change the output from 0 - 1 to 1 - 0
and change mode from push to switch

open mail and copy the auth code
download blynk library and install
Blynk Libraries:- https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/release
extract the zip file
copy the files and paste in Arduino folder in the documents folder
now open arduino ide and go to file->examples->blynk->boards_wifi->esp8266_standalone
run the code and change the credentials properly using auth code.
now tap play button to start and power the nodemcu.

8. Google Assistance Blynk and IFTTT Connection
Go to IFTTT
click on create
click on "+ this" and search google assistance
select say a phrase
type in the phrases you wish to say
write the response you wish from google assistance
click on create trigger


then click on "+ that" and search for webhooks

then click on make a web request
copy blynk url:- 
Blynk Server (INDIA):-
http://188.166.206.43/authcode/update/D0
*NOTE:- D3 pin of nodemcu corresponds to D0 pin of arduino
select Put
select application/json
write ["0"] to turn on the switch 
*{Body =["0"] ( Here 0 means to turn on digital pin D3 for Google Assistance)}
repeat same for turning off with ["1"] and save

then go to arduino IDE and select file>examples>Blynk>Boards_Wifi>ESP8266_Standalone
run that code on nodemcu changing the username,password of wifi and the auth token recieved via email.
